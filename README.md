# gatsby-bootstrap-contentful-starter

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration plus its already configured with bootstrap and contentful.
I created this started based on the gatsby default starter for use of my own project

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-bootstrap-starter https://github.com/ayhamthemayhem/gatsby-bootstrap-contentful-starter
    ```

1. **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-bootstrap-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-bootstrap-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
